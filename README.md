# EconomyCraft
EconomyCraft is a Bukkit economy plugin that provides basic economic functions as well as AI market players.

## Features
- Trading
- Banking
- Taxing
- AI players

### Trading
Players can trade items in markets anywhere around the world. The trading system is based on the bid and ask price in all the markets, and trades are settled when buyers and sellers agree on a price.

To implement the feel of localised economies, when items are traded between different markets (exports), the plugin increases the price of items depending on the distance between the markets. All the different localised economies form a single economy which uses a single currency (multiple currencies may be implemented in future updates).

Standalone shops may be implemented by creating markets without import and export, and allow only the owner of the market to sell.

### Banking
Banks in EconomyCraft serve to provide money-safekeeping, the ability to invest in various markets, and funding services for players. May provide financial instruments and assets. (Taxing?) (Central Bank?) (National Reserve?)

### Taxing
A portion of income from trades and interest can be taxed. Tax revenue goes to a predefined account which may be the 'government's.

### AI Players
NPC entities that interact with the players and other NPCs through the economy.
LON?
NPC entities with adaptation and learning capabilities? Interacts with players through the economy and PHYSICAL? (If they interact physically won't that be beyond the scope of the plugin? don't think they need to actually go farm wood and metals if thats what you mean by physical. Possibly implemented in future update? ver2.0?)
