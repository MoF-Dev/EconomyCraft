# EconomyCraft
EconomyCraft is a Bukkit economy plugin that provides basic economic functions as well as AI market players.

## Features
- Trading
- Banking
- Taxing
- AI players

### Trading
Players can trade items in markets anywhere around the world. The trading system is based on the bid and ask price in all the markets, and trades are settled when buyers and sellers agree on a price.

To implement the feel of localised economies, when items are traded between different markets, the plugin increases the price of items depending on the distance between the markets. All the different localised economies form a single economy which uses a single currency (multiple currencies may be implemented in future updates).

### Banking
Banks in EconomyCraft serve to provide money-safekeeping and investment and funding services for players.

### Taxing
A portion of income from trades and ___ can be taxed.

### AI Players
LON?
NPC entities with adaptation and learning capabilities? Interacts with players through the economy and PHYSICAL? (If they interact physically won't that be beyond the scope of the plugin?)
